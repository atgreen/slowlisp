Zach Beane's Quicklisp** project is amazing.  It's a library manager
and repository for over 300 Common Lisp libraries.  Thank you Zach!
Development for Common Lisp will never be the same.

For production deployment on Linux, on the other hand, packaging
projects in RPM format is often the way to go.

Slowlisp is simply a staging area for Quicklisp derived spec files
that I hope to one day submit to the Fedora project.

Fedora uses Common Lisp Controller as a library manager.

Package installation works like so...

$ yum install hunchentoot

And then load it with Common Lisp Controller into your favorite Lisp like so...

(clc:clc-require :huchentoot)
